# E-commerce Grocery Store

This project is a small e-commerce grocery store built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Icons. It is created using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-grocery-store.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd e-commerce-grocery-store
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start building your e-commerce grocery store by modifying the source code files located in the `src` directory. The project is set up with hot module replacement, so any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the browser.

To build the production-ready version of the application, you can run:
